# Asteroid
This project was done for the Nasa Space Apps Challenge solving the "Visualize the Asteroid Skies" challenge.
We have worked for 2 days with no sleep on this project and have achieved a lot of results.

By downloading the WebApp you can run it anywhere it wil automatically connect with our already filtered API.
If you wish to contribute to our project please contact us, we look forward to it!
We are happy to get criticised. It will drive us to be more precise and build better things!
